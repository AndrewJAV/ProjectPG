# UNI RedCode

A 3D first-person shooter prototype built with Python and ModernGL.

---

## 📌 Description

**UNI RedCode** is a tech demo exploring 3D game development using Python. It features custom model loading, an interactive camera, real-time lighting, collision detection, and basic enemy AI — all built from scratch using ModernGL.

This project began as an educational experiment, and despite its simplicity, it reflects a growing understanding of OpenGL, shader programming, and engine structure.

> It may not be AAA, but it's fully mine.

## 🔧 Features

- ✅ 3D rendering with ModernGL
- ✅ First-person camera with collision detection
- ✅ Custom `OBJ` model loader with material/texture support
- ✅ Enemies that track and shoot at the player (`GreenDrone`, `BlueDrone`)
- ✅ Dynamic lighting (directional, spot, and point lights)
- ✅ Skybox implementation
- ✅ Bullet collision system (player and enemy projectiles)
- ✅ Weapon view model (`WeaponView`) with aiming and recoil animations
- ✅ Sound effect support (in progress)
- ✅ Includes a full-scale 3D model of the **Universidad Nacional de Ingeniería (UNI)** in Nicaragua

## ⚙️ Why Python + ModernGL?

Python was chosen for its ease of use and flexibility in rapid prototyping, especially when combined with [ModernGL](https://github.com/moderngl/moderngl), a simple and powerful wrapper over OpenGL. It allowed us to focus on gameplay systems and graphics logic without getting bogged down in verbose boilerplate.

For collision detection, **Oriented Bounding Boxes (OBB)** were used instead of axis-aligned boxes for better performance and accuracy when dealing with rotated or irregular 3D models.

The combination of Python + ModernGL + OBB collisions strikes a balance between **performance**, **simplicity**, and **flexibility** — making it ideal for a learning-oriented engine prototype.
